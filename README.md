# Decentralized-Skill-Verification-System

## Project Description
The Decentralized Skill Verification System is a blockchain-based smart contract platform that enables individuals to securely add, verify, and manage their professional or personal skills on a decentralized ledger. Verifiers such as employers, educators, or peers can endorse a userâ€™s skills, ensuring transparent and tamper-proof skill validation.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a trustworthy, transparent, and tamper-resistant platform for skill verification that empowers users to showcase authentic abilities and achievements without relying on centralized authorities. This will foster better opportunities and trust in professional ecosystems worldwide.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Skill Verification:** Skills are added and verified by trusted parties on the blockchain.
- **User-Controlled Skill Portfolio:** Users maintain ownership of their skill data and can choose which skills to display.
- **Verifiable Records:** Each skill entry contains verifier info and timestamp to guarantee authenticity.
- **Permissioned Skill Removal:** Only the original verifier can remove a skill endorsement, maintaining accountability.
